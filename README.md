Aberrant R package from https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~spencer/Aberrant/

Aberrant is a super useful R package but it seems to no longer be available in CRAN. I am not the author of this software; rather, this is a mirror.

When I use this package, I cite the following paper: [Bellenguez, C. et al. A robust clustering algorithm for identifying problematic samples in genome-wide association studies. *Bioinformatics* **28**, 134â€“135 (2012). PMID 22057162.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22057162/)


To install:

```R
library("devtools")

install_github("carbocation/aberrant")

library("aberrant")

```
